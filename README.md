Jokes are fun, but sometimes they can go too far. Please don't use this tool to send anything offensive or otherwise inappropriate. Use good judgment in determining both your email's content and its recipients. I am not responsible if you let your joke get out of hand...

Furthermore, this prank does admittedly involve fooling people into thinking they've received a genuine email from Salesforce.com (although your user's email address will still be listed as the sender). If any Salesforce employee finds this repository to be in violation of Salesforce's terms or would like me to remove its content for any reason please contact me at scott.b.covert@gmail.com and I will take it down right away.

Happy April Fool's!
